She couldn’t wait to head to school. Whatever Oliver had found, it must’ve been important enough for him to search up Mae’s email and send the message.
	At school, mostly nothing happened. During the class when Mae and Oliver were together, they didn’t have a chance to talk, because the teacher was strict about being on schedule and not being distracted.
	After school, though, Mae would be able to hear what Oliver had found. They would be able to exchange the information that they worked hard to find.
	It felt like a long time, but finally, after many hours, school had ended and the last bell had rung.
	Oliver was waiting on a bench next to the flagpole.
	“Mae! I have so much to tell you,” he said.
	“Me too!” Mae said. “You can go first.”
	Oliver told Mae everything about what he had found and what had happened, from the time that he got hit by those slimy green balls, to the moment he entered his dad’s workspace, to the second that he had opened the book.
	“That’s… that’s amazing…” Mae murmured, struggling to find the right words. “So… your dad is connected with Tulip Street somehow?”
	“I guess. And from what I’ve seen, it doesn’t seem like it’s in a good way. He’s willing to send one of his sons to the orphanage in order to protect ‘Tulip Street’, apparently,” Oliver said.
	“True,” Mae said. “You have to go down to that workspace tomorrow and find new things. There has to be more information on that board.”
	“Yeah. Yesterday night I was really tired, and I guess I missed some information,” Oliver said.
	“Those slimy green balls that hit you… they didn’t do anything to you?” Mae asked.
	“Nope. But I theorize that they were meant to make me lose my memory and knock me unconscious,” Oliver said. “It’s weird that it didn’t work on me.”
	“Yeah,” Mae said. “Maybe one of the books on your dad’s bookshelf contains more information on those slimy green balls.”
	“Good point. I’ll check that out.” Oliver said.
	Mae was incredibly excited, but worried at the same time. Excited because everything seemed to be coming together, but worried because Tulip Street was now confirmed to be connected to some supernatural thing. Nobody could control the supernatural…
	“So that book that you found, do you think you can try The Art of Warping on me?” Mae asked.
	“Oh, no, I don’t think so… the book said that you are only able to warp if your powers surfaced at age 8. I got my powers later than that,” Oliver said.
	“It doesn’t hurt to try,” Mae said.
	“True. But those instructions were incredibly vague…” Oliver said, his voice trailing off.
	“Pleeeease?” Mae asked.
	“Fine. I’ll try it,” Oliver said.
	Oliver closed his eyes, and had a look of concentration on his face that nobody could break.
	(People were starting to look at Oliver in confusion at what he was doing, and then walk away slowly).
	“Think of something that you don’t fully believe in,” Oliver ordered, still closing his eyes.
	“Ok…” Mae said.
	She thought about not being able to find the person in Tulip Street. It was something that she didn’t fully believe in. She still thought that they would be able to find that man in Tulip Street.
	That man might even be Oliver’s dad…
	She reset her thoughts to “not being able to find the person in Tulip Street.”
	“Got it,” Mae said.
	Oliver closed his eyes even more and he clenched his fist. It was turning white.
	Y’know how as ocean waves pull back, your feet feel like they’re being dragged into the ocean? Well, that was what Mae was feeling right now, but in her own brain, and she had no control over it.
	Finally, the waves released, and her thoughts had changed from, “not being able to find the person from Tulip Street,” to, “being able to find the person from Tulip Street.”
	“Did it work?” Oliver asked, sounding exhausted. He was covered in sweat as well.
	“Yes! It was amazing!” Mae exclaimed.
	“Great. So… now I can warp minds?” Oliver said slowly.
	“I guess…” Mae said.
	“Well, I’d need more practice in order to get it more fluently.” Oliver said. “Mae, can you describe what it felt like to have your mind warped?”
	Mae described every little detail about how it felt like to have her mind warped. How it felt like her brain was being sucked into the ocean, having no control over her thoughts, and how it felt like to have her thoughts be fully changed.
	“That’s… amazing… I wish I could have it happen to me, just so I could feel it myself,” Oliver said wishfully.
	“You could… try to warp your own mind…” Mae suggested.
	Oliver looked skeptical. “I doubt that would work… but… I’ll try it.” he said.
	Oliver closed his eyes and clenched his fist once more. This time, it took about half the time in order for him to warp. He was concentrating for about 30 seconds when he finally opened his eyes.
	“IT WORKED!” he yelled. A few people looked at him like he was crazy.
	“We… we should probably do this somewhere else,” Mae said.
	“True,” Oliver said.
	Together, they walked towards Tulip Street. It took a while, but they finally reached the clearing in which forest turned into clean paved roads and perfectly positioned houses.
	“So, how was it like to warp your own thought?” Mae asked.
	“It was amazing,” Oliver breathed. “It was exactly as you described it. Like the ocean was sucking my old skeptical thoughts and spitting out new ones. I gotta try this on my dad.”
	“Yeah,” Mae said.
	“So, should we explore some more houses in Tulip Street?” Oliver asked.
	“Sure!” Mae said. “I’ll show you where I last left off.” 
	The walk was incredibly long to reach where Mae had last left off in the houses, but finally, they reached it.
	“Let’s explore this one.” Mae said, indicating one of the houses. (Identical to every other house)
	Inside the house was the same as usual, just some dusty old floors and cobwebs scattered across the place.
	Just as they were going to leave, they noticed that the wall wasn’t completely normal. In small handwriting were words. Oliver and Mae examined the words.
	Mae’s heartbeat accelerated. She broke out in a cold sweat. Her limbs were cold.
	Oliver read the words, “I know what you did, Oliver Stone. You will never see the light of day again.”
	A slimy green ball slid into the room, emitting green vapor.
	Mae coughed once, her knees buckled, and she collapsed onto the hard-wood floor.
