Chapter 14
Elliot
	“Follow me, Elliot. I shall lead you to my partner.” Master said, smiling slightly.
	Master went down where they had come from, through that dirt path that seemed to be like a jungle. It seemed out of place, considering they had just come from one of the most beautiful things in the universe… Tulip Street.
	Tulip Street was interesting. The houses, architecture, and all that were magnificent. But the perfectly laid out houses, for as far as the eye could see, were a little creepy.
	After what seemed like an hour of walking, the path began to widen into a gravel road. Then, later, it morphed into a paved road. 
	Elliot continued following Master. Master took lefts and rights and many turns, but finally, they arrived at a house. 
	The house was somewhat small, and was old. The scarce windows were broken and worn down. It seemed like a haunted house out of a horror movie. 
	Master opened the door (which was as equally worn down as the windows).
	“After you,” Master said, opening the door.
	Elliot stepped in, and the moment he did, the floor creaked. Good thing the lights were all turned on, otherwise it would’ve been ten times more creepy.
	“I thought I told you not to come barging into my house randomly!” A man said.
	“I know, I know,” Master said. “But remember my orders….”
	“Yes, yes.” the man said.
	The two men talked like they were friends. Wait, no. Not entirely friends. It was clear that Master was above the other man.
	The man’s eyes caught Elliot. He stopped in his tracks. His smile faded and his eyes widened. 
	It took a while for the man to speak.
	“Master?” he said slowly. “Wha- what have you done?” 
	“What did I do?” Master said slowly. Slyly. With a slight smile on his face.
	“You know what you did. I mean, come on. That was a cowardly thing to do. You thought you were able to… er… culture the other one, but no. His powers are going to be as strong—if not stronger than yours.” Master said. 
	“But—” the man said.
	“But… your attempts at concealing your thoughts were futile. Miniscule, at best. Your son already knows more about you… about us.” 
	“W-what about the other one?” the man asked. He glanced quickly at Elliot, and then looked away.
	“Don’t be a coward. You know what his name is. SPEAK IT.” Master said. He was starting to look scary. His disheveled hair, scars across his face, scratches left and right.
	“W-what about…” the man coughed. “E-elliot?” 
	The man sounded like he had never said the name, “Elliot” in his entire life, yet he seemed to know so much about the name anyway. It was weird. Master would have to give Elliot an explanation as to what was happening here.
	“Elliot’s powers are just starting to grow. And trust me. They will be the strongest powers you’ve ever seen in your entire lifetime. Probably ranked as one of the strongest powers I’ve ever seen in my lifetime.” 
	The man looked at Elliot with a combination of anger, disgust, awe, and confusion.
	Master turned to Elliot.
	“Elliot. That man over there is your father. He, being his usual cowardly self, sent you to the orphanage because he thought that he was unable to raise you. He thought that your powers would become too strong. He thought…. He thought that disowning you… abandoning you… would be the best… easiest choice. He was wrong. Your father was wrong to abandon you.” Master said.
	“With your father’s help, and mine, of course, we could’ve cultured you and your brother to get the strongest powers in existence. But your father chose the easy way out. The cowards’ way.” Master spat.

	Just then, a boy came in.
	“That boy is your brother. Oliver.” Master said. He treated this as if he was expecting it.
	“Wh-what? How did you know I was spying on you?” Oliver asked, backing away.
	“I will never tell you. Besides, it was obvious. But that isn’t the point.” Master said.
	“Oliver. Meet Elliot. Elliot. Meet Oliver.” Master ordered.
	They awkwardly greeted each other. 
	“Why did you throw those… balls… at me? Why are you on that Master guy’s side? Heck, why is my dad on that Master guy’s side? What the heck is happening?” Oliver asked.
	“We will explain all of that later. For now…. I have one question for you, Oliver.”
	“Yes?” Oliver asked shakily.
	“Join our side… Oliver… The side that your brother and your father are on. The winning side. The side that will conquer the world. Join us, Oliver.” Master said. “If you say no, then you will have marked yourself as an enemy. An enemy, for years and years to come. And then… and then… the whole world will be against you. And there will be no turning back. The winning side will conquer the world. And there is no stopping us.”
