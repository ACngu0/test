Chapter 7
Oliver
	Pain. All he really could feel was pain. The last thing he remembered was his dad throwing a weird ball covered in some weird green substance.
	When he woke up, his dad was right in front of him.
	“Son?” he asked, in a way-too-innocent voice.
	“Yes?” Oliver said.
	“Do you… remember anything? Do you remember what happened today?” his dad said. His dad’s dull blue eyes were staring into his soul. He looked like he wanted Oliver to say no.
	What did Oliver remember today? Well, he had helped Mae decipher a weird code that meant, “Oliver and Elliot.” Later, he went to Dad and asked him who Elliot was. Then, his dad threw a ball covered with a slimy green substance on him, and he was knocked unconscious. Supposedly, throwing the slimy green ball was, “For the greater good.”
	Then came the question, was Oliver supposed to remember that? By the look on his dad’s face, no.
	“Well?” dad asked impatiently.
	“No. I don’t remember anything. I don’t think I did anything today. I just… woke up…” Oliver lied.
	“Good.” Dad said. He patted Oliver on the head and went up to sleep.
	It must be late. He checked the clock. It was twelve minutes past midnight. 
	Oliver was still confused after what his dad did. He remembered his father’s words, “For the greater good.” The green balls must, supposedly, erase Oliver’s memory of that day, and knock him unconscious. But the balls didn’t do that. He could still remember clearly what happened yesterday. That was weird.
	In addition to that, what information could’ve been that important and secretive that his father needed to knock him out for?
	He would have to think about this later. He had better things to do.
	This was the perfect chance to find out more information about Tulip Street, and about Elliot. And his dad wouldn’t be able to find out. He could already hear him snoring.
	Carefully, he went downstairs. He knew that his dad had a small workspace down in the basement. The workspace had always been off-limits for Oliver. 
	What caught Oliver’s suspicions was that his father was in the workspace almost throughout the entire day (when he wasn’t somewhere else, at “work”). 
	The moment he saw the workspace, he knew something was fishy. Firstly, the room smelled like rotten eggs. That was the exact smell of the slimy green balls. It smelled putrid, and he had to hold his nose.
	Second of all, the room was flashing green, almost like the color of those slimy green balls. 
	Third, the room was filled with all sorts of gadgets and broken things.
	Last, in the middle of the room was a large board that had small red strings of yarn that connected to two words: Tulip Street.
	Oliver’s dad had something to do with Tulip Street.
	This was the closest that he would get to finding information about Tulip Street. Carefully, he stepped upstairs and closed the door. He tried to make it seem as if he was never there.
	Then, he went to his room (which was on the first floor) and grabbed his computer. 
	His hands shaking slightly, he started to type an email to Mae about what he had found.
	Oliver knew that his dad monitored his every move. His dad definitely didn’t trust him, to the point that he would use supernatural green-ball-type-thingies that erase your memory against him.
	He had to keep this message as cryptic as possible. He replaced the mention of “Tulip Street,” with “You-know-what,” and he didn’t explain any details of what he had found. 
	Oliver was still itching to check his dad’s workroom again. He couldn’t help but to head downstairs once more.
	The shining green light seemed brighter than usual, and the smell was horrible, as always.
	He examined the large board with yarn connecting pieces of information to the center-piece: Tulip Street. The board kind of reminded him of boards that super-villains had to keep track of information in movies.
	He noticed his name on it, again. Oliver, and that other kid: Elliot. (Which was probably his brother). 
	Another thing that he noticed was the string of yarn that connected Elliot’s name to a piece of information. There was a box of text that read: “Sent to orphanage; keep his powers weak enough so that he cannot disrupt the project in Tulip Street.”
	Huh? Powers? Could that be… mind-reading? Like his own powers?
	Then he noticed the string of yarn that connected Oliver’s name to a piece of information. The box read: “Safe to keep; at least for now. His powers are less likely to disrupt the project.” 
	Oliver was somehow more confused after he read the two pieces of information than before he had read them. What did his dad mean when Oliver’s powers are less likely to disrupt the project?
	What even is the project? And why is it so important that Dad sent his own son to the orphanage?
	He was getting tired. However, Oliver didn’t like to sleep while leaving questions unanswered.
	Even though it was large, Oliver hadn’t noticed the bookshelves that seemed to line the entire perimeter of the workspace. 
	One thick book caught his eye. He grabbed it instinctively. 
	In a large, bold, majestic font were the words:

Mind-Reading, Telekinesis, and other mysterious and Magical Powers
A Comprehensive Guide

	This was the exact book that he needed his entire life! (Or most of it, anyway)
	Oliver opened up the book, his hands numb, and feet cold with anticipation. On the table of contents were many things. A few that caught his eye were, “Telekinesis: How to stop your food from flying out of your mouth,” or “Seeing the future: Telling between a vision and a dream.”
	The author of this book must’ve had a sense of humor. He went to the cover and looked down at where the author’s name would’ve been. Nothing. No author at all. Makes sense for a cryptic book that tells about magical powers….
	He flipped to the “Mind-Reading” chapter and started reading.

Mind-Reading, commonly found in children with a father or a mother that can also Mind-Read, is one of the most mysterious powers in the universe. Not much is known about Mind-Reading, as there are few beings who have this power.
	In this chapter, we will learn more about Mind-Reading: Its origins, famous people who had it, and a long line of mind-readers that started thousands of years ago: The Stones.

	What?! That was Oliver’s last name: Stone! How was that possible? Was that just a coincidence? Or was he really one of the “Long line of mind-readers that started thousands of years ago.”
	He continued reading.

	People have their likes, their dislikes, and thoughts, and thousands of other offsprings of what we call the brain.
To fully understand the “superpowered” brain, we must start at the beginning of the story.
Sir Caveat Stone Ⅱ, an emperor from the 12th century, was rumored to have immense control over his mind, or put in primal terms; “mind over matter.”
Of course, the rumors were rumors. But his closer friends and advisors and such were so terrified of him. They claimed that he could know their every thought, and detect the slightest hint of disloyalty or betrayal.
30 years after he  assumed a royal position, he had two children. One, had inherited the cunning of his father, and was much more bitter and cruel than the Caveat, his father.
Sir Caveat Stone Ⅱ got increasingly powerful, gaining the knowledge of a thousand minds. Nobody could stop him, as his empire grew. Rumors continued on about his mind-reading. No one dared step in his way.
Eventually, the only one who could stop Sir Caveat Stone Ⅱ’s increasing tyranny was his son Sir Caveat Stone III. 
His son ended up assassinating the emperor and ended up victorious. 
 I closed my eyes. And kept them closed for about a minute. Then, I opened my eyes. The book was still there, in my hands. I inhaled a deep breath and exhaled slowly.
I took one glance at the book, and shivered. It was so tiny, compared to the big things in the world. It was so tiny, compared to the problems that had risen in the past few weeks. And yet… And yet… it might be the biggest thing ever.
