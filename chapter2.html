   Chapter 2
Mae
	I remember the day, six years ago, when I was only five years old, as clear as water from a lake. We had set up a campfire that blazed with hot coals and colorful orange flames. It was nearing Halloween, the trees losing their leaves, turning to thin brown figures, barely lit up by the flickering flames. 
My cousins were there, telling a scary story at our campsite. At that time, I wasn’t really a fan of them. They sent chills down my spine, when I woke up at night, dreams of werewolves and spirits jarring me to the bone. But this time I was determined to move on. I needed to grow up. I was five years old, after all.
“Mae, are you ready for a spooky story?” My older cousin asked. He was on the other side of the campfire, his face illuminated by the inferno, shadows dancing across his face.
I nodded weakly, a barely perceptible movement of my head.
“This… is the Legend of Tulip Street.”
	My legs shook in anticipation. What was the story of Tulip Street? What could it be about? What horror awaited my 5-year-old self?
	My oldest cousin leaned in from his camp chair. He closed his eyes, as if picturing the exact moment in which his story took place.
	“It was a cold dark night, barely a lamp in sight. Much like now,” he paused, glancing around. “Tulip Street was never known for its kind neighbors. In fact, the neighbors were nonexistent. Not a single soul inhabited the houses. The houses were identical. Perfect copies of one another. Same rows of bushes, same lawn, same house design, and the same colors.”
	I shivered involuntarily. I was beginning to regret this, but, as I had realized, once you started listening to a story, you badly wanted to finish it.
	“Rumors started to spread around about Tulip Street. People said that something fishy was going on in the seemingly empty houses. A little something related to teleportation.” 
	“Teleportation?” I asked, elated. This sounded great, not like something out of a spooky story.
	“Yes. The Legend of Tulip Street goes on to this day. And people say that the experiments still go on. And the creator of the experiments? They say that he is angry at the people who speak of The Legend of Tulip Street. They say that he’d make those who speak of it teleport to somewhere barren and deserted, never to be seen again.”
	
	Sometimes, Mae still wakes up in a pool of cold sweat, recalling The Legend of Tulip Street. Something about teleportation and the supernatural just strikes her.
	Anyway, Mae didn’t have to think about the scary part of teleportation anymore. She remembered the first time that my cousin led her to Tulip Street. She nearly fainted at the sight of it. It was as if it was from some kind of mystical fairy tale. Sun that was previously blocked with hundreds of branches and leaves now shone brightly through perfect houses that stretched on for what seemed like miles. Houses placed with accuracy to the nearest centimeter. It was beautiful.
	Now, Mae couldn’t enjoy Tulip Street without feeling like there was a gaping hole in her chest. Shortly after her cousin had shown her Tulip Street, he disappeared. Gone. Without a trace. Was it a coincidence? Mae liked to think so, because otherwise, if someone had not wanted her cousin to be sharing where Tulip Street was, then she could be in big trouble. Deathly trouble. Teleportation related trouble…
	Mae had to stop thinking about these things. She had to continue the work that her cousin had wanted her to do. Find out more about teleportation. 
	She headed towards one of the houses. Any one of these houses could contain something about teleportation. 
	Sometimes, Mae questioned her cousin. She had spent many hours every single day of the week, trying each house, meticulously searching for a sign of teleportation.  Her cousin had told her that he had found a house that had a person in it. The only house in hundreds that had a living being in it. He had told her that the person in it had teleported an object. A small one. A slice of cheese, a wooden ball. He had told her that the object got teleported out of sight. Using seemingly nothing. 
	Was the story fiction or truth? Tulip Street was weird enough, but teleportation? Even Mae had to question it after years of searching, and finding nothing. 
	It was incredibly dull to search the houses, because all of them seemed the same. Perfect replicas of each other, inside and out. Same furniture, dusty floor, paint colors, wallpaper, same everything.  
	Mae entered one of the houses, hoping to find something interesting, something different from the norm, but finding nothing other than spider webs and dead insects. 
	Mae’s goal was to search three houses every day. Half-way through the second house, Mae found something weird. Something that Mae had never seen before throughout the years of searching. Food.
	The tables of each house on Tulip Street were empty. Every single one. At least, that’s what Mae thought. 
	Laid peacefully on the table was a half-decomposed, moldy slice of cheese. There was nothing else on the table. 
	Didn’t her cousin tell her that the man who discovered how to teleport things teleported a slice of cheese? That was true, but the thing that the man teleported always changed, according to her cousin. One day, her cousin would say that the man teleported an old sock. Another day, her cousin would say that the man teleported a slice of cheese. Was Mae just delusional, hoping that the one thing that had been different from normal was actually an important find, and not just any old slice of cheese? Or was her cousin lying to her about this whole thing? Teleportation and all.
	Her cousin couldn’t be lying to her. His last words to her was to ask her to continue searching Tulip Street for a sign, any sign, of teleportation, or the man who could teleport things. It was his dying wish. She couldn’t let her cousin down. She was going to find the man who could teleport things, if it was the last thing she would do.
	She picked up the moldy cheese and examined it. There was nothing. Just an ordinary piece of cheese. With her bad luck, someone probably left the cheese there for some reason and went away. Nothing teleportation related. 
	She flipped the cheese over, disgusted at having to touch something that smelled like 3-year-old diapers covered with mold. As she set the cheese back on the table, she noticed something. A small sheet of paper, slipped carefully within a small cut in the slice of cheese. This wasn’t any ordinary slice of cheese. It had the possibility of containing the secrets to teleportation.
	She cautiously pulled out the yellowing paper, careful not to rip it. Written on the paper were some kind of symbols, kind of like hieroglyphics. 
	Great, now I have to decode this. 
	With her phone, she took a photo of the hieroglyphics, so that she could research it online later. 
	“How could someone be so interested in a slice of cheese?” 
	It took her a lot of willpower to keep herself from screaming from surprise. Mae recognized this voice. It had talked to her during school about Tulip Street. Oliver.
	“Why did you follow me?” Mae asked coldly. Oliver didn’t have the right to see Tulip Street. It was secret. This aside, Mae couldn’t help from thinking about the fact that her cousin had disappeared shortly after he had shown her Tulip Street, and Mae had technically just shown Oliver where Tulip Street was. Could this mean that she was next on the list for the person who made her cousin disappear?
	“Uhm… I wanted to ask you more about Tulip Street…” he said, and his voice dropped off after looking at Mae’s glare.
	“Didn’t you get that I didn’t want to tell you about Tulip Street?” Mae demanded.
	“Yeah but…”
	“But, you didn’t want to listen to me, so you decided to stalk me and follow me through a forest. How desperate could you be?” I asked. Why would Oliver want to know about Tulip Street so much? So much that he would follow a girl that he never talked to at all, through a dense forest. Did he know something about Tulip Street that Mae didn’t?
	Oliver looked ashamed in himself, as if rethinking his idea to follow Mae through a forest.
	“I mean… I just wanted to know more about Tulip Street… and I guess I got my wish,” Oliver said.
	“What do you really want to know about Tulip Street? And why do you want to know about it so desperately?
	“I… I can’t tell you…”
	Oh come on. You follow me through a forest, hoping to find out more about Tulip Street, and you can’t even tell me why you want to know more about Tulip Street?
	“Sorry… I uh…” Oliver said and then he looked livid. He clenched his fist and closed his eyes.
	Did Oliver just… no… that couldn’t be possible. It was definitely a coincidence. Maybe Oliver is just crazy… it couldn’t be possible… no way. Oliver was either crazy, or something fishy was going on…
	“Sorry what?” Mae asked.
	He flinched and looked at the floor of the dusty house.
	“I… I have to go…” Oliver said and then turned his back. His fist remained clenched.
	“Come back here! Now! You can’t just leave after you see Tulip Street! Tell me what that sorry was about!” I yelled.
Oliver slowly turned around, and his eyes were still on the floor as he said, “I…  I can read minds.”
“R-read minds?” Mae said slowly.
“Yes…” Oliver said.
“So… why did you want to visit Tulip Street?” Mae asked. It took a while for Oliver to respond, and when he did, his voice wavered and was shaky. It sounded as if he had been bottling up what he was going to say for his entire life.
“The moment I found out that I could read minds, I searched for a solution. Something that could’ve caused my supernatural ability. I couldn’t find anything for 4 long years.” Oliver paused.
What Oliver said had stuck Mae, as she had been doing the same for the past 5 years. Searching dozens of houses on end.
“And when you came along and talked about Tulip Street, I thought it might be connected to my mind reading…” Oliver said.
“Maybe…”
Oliver’s mind reading could be connected to the teleportation. And if I can find out how, then it will solve a mystery that was kept dark for 5 years.
