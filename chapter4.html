	Chapter 4
Oliver
	Why? Why. Why did Oliver tell a girl that he didn’t even know his biggest secret? She’s gonna tell everybody in the school, and then they’ll all think Oliver was a freak. Police would be called, and he’d be in big trouble.
	“That’s… that’s amazing, Oliver…” Mae said slowly, trying (and failing) to recover from shock.
	“It’s not… really,” Oliver said coldly. “You can’t control it. It’s like an automatic whispering voice that rattles your skull and makes you want to jump out of your skin every few seconds.” 
	“Still… you can read minds!” Mae said.
	As if Oliver didn’t know that…
	“Enough about this mind-reading thing. Tell me more about Tulip Street,” he said.
	Mae looked visibly distressed. Her hands clenched, and her eyes narrowed slightly.
	“Fine,” Mae said. The one word brings an enormous amount of relief to Oliver. “Tulip Street was a mysterious place. Not only because of the perfect lines of houses and driveways and yards, but also because something fishy was going on in the houses. Something out of the ordinary.” Mae breathed a shaky breath. “Supposedly, a man created machines that can do godly things. Teleportation. Time travel. Mind reading.”
	Oliver’s heart skipped a beat. Mind reading?! This must be related to his weird power to read minds. He had to find out more about Tulip Street.
	“Th-that’s all I know about Tulip Street… I’ve been searching for years for a clue, anything to find the supernatural man,” Mae said.
	“Wait… after years of searching… you didn’t find anything?” Oliver asked. “Not one single clue? Does that mean that… that the supernatural man isn’t true?” 
	Mae looked at the floor, and her face became white. She clenched her fist. Oliver could tell this was a sensitive topic for Mae, but why? He couldn’t hear anything from Mae’s mind…
	“He exists. I know it. And I have found a clue,” Mae said. She opened her hand, and there was a small yellowing sheet of paper in the center. The sheet had scratchy writing on it.

	“I have no clue what this thing says. If you could help me decode it, I might be able to find more about Tulip Street,” Mae asked. 
	Oliver kept his eyes on the paper.
	“What do you mean ‘you have no clue what this thing says?’” Oliver asked.
	“I mean, there are just a bunch of gibberish symbols on this paper. Hieroglyphics or something,” Mae said, eyeing Oliver suspiciously. “Do you see something… different?”
	“Uhm… yes,” Oliver said slowly. He wasn’t entirely sure if telling Mae was the best decision.
	“What is it?” Mae asked, her eyes shining like little sapphires that glinted in the sun.
	Speaking of the sun, it was starting to go down. How could time possibly have passed so fast? (Then again, it was winter so it was around 5:00 when the sun started to set)
	“Two words…” Oliver said. His eyes were now on the paper, wondering if what he saw was different than what everyone else would see. Something fishy was going on.
	“What are the words?” Mae asked, starting to get impatient. Oliver still wasn’t sure if telling her was the right thing. For one thing, he barely knew her. For another, she would probably blab about what Oliver said to her friends, and then everyone would know his secret. 
	“The two words are Oliver and Elliot…” he said slowly. Somehow, when the words came out of his mouth, it didn’t sound like the way he had thought it would sound. His throat was raspy. 
	“You? Your name on that ancient paper? Come on, you have to be joking,” Mae said.
	“I’m not joking,” Oliver insisted. “I saw the words with my two eyes,” he continued.
	“Oliver is a common name, right? It certainly couldn’t have been your name…” Mae asked, more to convince herself.
	“Of course… yeah, that’s right…” Oliver said. “Hey, it’s getting late. I have to get back home. And I’m sure you have to be back as well, so maybe we can meet back tomorrow…”
	“Sure. And you better tell me more about your mind reading, like about when you can read minds,” Mae asked.
	“All right. And in return, you can tell me more about Tulip Street,” Oliver offered.
	“You dimwit, I’ve already said multiple times that I told you all I know about Tulip Street,” Mae said. “But see you tomorrow.”
	Mae turned her back, and started to leave. She mounted her bike and zoomed off. That left Oliver there by himself.
	She had taken the little sheet of paper, which only Oliver could read. He wondered what the words had meant. He wondered why his name was there, out of all the millions of possible names. His name. Was it something related to his mind reading abilities?
	Who was Elliot? He had to know. It was risky, but he decided that he would ask Dad. A few things could happen: 1, he would ignore him. 2, he would ground him for some mysterious reason (as he usually did). 3, he would tell him who Elliot was.
	He figured that nothing that bad would happen. He would leave out the part about the slip of paper. His dad didn’t need to know about that.
	After a tiring walk through the dense forest, he re-entered civilization and jogged towards his house. His heart was beating fast, but not because of his running, but because of his anticipation to see what his dad would say about the words on the slip of paper.
	Just then, he realized one thing. His dad probably wasn’t there. He was typically at some random place for “work”. 
	Despite this, as he entered home, he shouted, “Dad? Are you here?”
	Miraculously, a tired, somewhat annoyed voice answered, “Yes? What is it?”
	“I have a question… who is Elliot?” Oliver asked.
	Dad was drinking a cup of warm water. When Oliver had asked Dad that question, his hand had made an involuntary twitch, and half the cup spilled onto his lap. One of his eyes twitched, and his eyes darted around nervously. 
	“W-what do you mean Elliot?” Dad asked. “I mean, I don’t know who he is, but why did you ask that… I mean… who…” 
	Dad’s voice dropped off. He must’ve gotten the notion that he was sounding extremely suspicious.
	“You know who Elliot is,” Oliver accused. Dad’s hands were shaking now.
	“I-I don’t…” Dad said.
	“Tell me who Elliot is. Now.” Oliver demanded.
	“How did you find out that name?” Dad asked coldly.
	“I won’t tell you. Now tell me who Elliot is.” Oliver said.
	“I’m sorry to have to do this…” Dad said. “But it’s for the greater good. Master wouldn’t want you to know about this.”
	Dad pulled out a small ball that was covered in a slimy green substance. It smelled sickly, like rotten eggs. He threw the ball onto the floor, and immediately it exploded with some kind of powder.
	Everything went black.
