Chapter 11
Elliot
	Elliot was going to die. As the blood seeped out of the wound, he felt more and more faint. 
	He tried to drag himself forward, away from the creature, but each inch of movement caused the wound to hurt ten times more.
	As the creature slashed another deep wound into his calf, he just wanted to die. The pain was too immense.
	“Kill… me… already…” he said weakly. 
	Just then, a person charged out from behind the creature. It was wearing a mask and all black, making it just a blur. The figure stabbed it in the leg with a long, silver sword. The person stood no chance… the creature was 10 times bigger than him.
	The person survived. The person dodged the creature’s swings and swipes, and stabbed the creature once more in the leg. The sword was dripping with a weird blue-green blood.
	The creature roared and reared its head. It charged at the person, and just as it was about to make impact, the person dodged, causing the creature to crash into a boulder.
	The crash caused smaller rocks and stones to fall on the creature’s back. 
	Imagine an avalanche, but with stones and boulders. That’s what happened to the creature. It was covered with stones and large boulders, causing it to be fully trapped. There was no way out. You could see the creature struggling, but not being able to escape.
	Eventually, the struggling died down, and the creature stopped moving. It had suffocated. Most likely dead.
	That left the question, who was the person who had killed the creature?
	Was it a human? Or was it something else? Something more mysterious…
	“W-who are you?” Elliot asked. He expected his voice to come out stronger, but it ended up breaking down like a scared child. (Which he was.)
	In response, the figure took off its mask. 
	He could barely make out that the figure was a man. The face was not really a face. It was worn down, scratches distorting facial features, and a large scar down one eye that stretched down to the jaw. A fine layer of dirt and other filth covered the figure’s face.
	“W-who are you?” Elliot asked once more. His voice was still shaking.
	“I’m your savior, Elliot.” The figure said. His voice matched his face. It was worn down as well, as if he’d just been screaming. It was gruff and sounded like a growl.
	“H..how do you know my name?” Elliot asked, his voice wavering like a thin sheet of paper in the wind. 
	“I have my ways… and it is not your biggest thing to worry about, Elliot.” The man said. “Your wound, I can help fix that.” 
	“I don’t trust you… I mean, you saved my life, but how do I know you’re not just gonna kill me?” Elliot asked.
	“Don’t worry. I’m safe.” the man said and muttered a few words. 
	The pain on Elliot’s calf and stomach subsided immediately, replaced by a soft, cool feeling.
	“Thank you so much!” Elliot exclaimed.
	“No problem. Let me tell you a story.” the man said.
	What story? The story of himself? How he became who he is? This was going to be interesting.
	“Sure,” he said. (Elliot knew that the man probably wouldn’t take no for an answer)
	“My story begins when I was a young boy. My parents left me. I was sent to an orphanage.” the man said. He took a large intake of breath before he continued. “I was troubled, as a child. I sought the kindness of my mother and father that I would never have.”
	That sounded a lot like Elliot… minus the troubled part.
	“I thought that the orphanage was the cause of my problems, and I escaped. I brought food and water along with me, enough for me to survive for a while. After I ran out of the food and water, I had to resort to stealing.” the man takes a shaky breath. “One day, I was stealing a few loaves of bread, when the shop-owner came and pointed a gun at my head.”
	“I had no choice. It was life or death. I charged at him… and… stole his gun…” a tear rolled down his cheek; down his scar. “I shot him.”
	This guy must be crazy…
	“... my biggest regret…” the man said remorsefully. “They caught me, of course. The cops. The judge ruled that I was to be sent to death.”
	So how did this guy get out of jail? Did he escape? Or was he pardoned somehow?
	“I was sent to death row for eight years. I contemplated my death for those eight long years. I was ready to die.” he said slowly. He took another shaky breath. “I was finally told my execution date. On that day, I took my last shower, I ate my last meal, I would speak my last words.”
	The trees whistled softly and the grass seemed to look away.
	“My death would be… experimental. They were trying a new device… one that could, supposedly, teleport me.”
	“A teleportation device?” Elliot repeated, amazed.
	“Yes. Allegedly, it would’ve teleported me to the execution room. Their reasoning was that if I had died during the teleportation, it didn’t matter; I was already going to be sent to death. If the teleportation device worked, problem solved: You have a working teleportation device and one dead inmate.”
	“Did it teleport you then?” he asked slowly.
	“Yes. But not to the next execution room. To another dimension. I have seen things that mankind will never see. The being above all beings knew that I was a young boy when I committed my crime, and I had a troubled life in the orphanage, and that mostly, what I did was in self-defense.” 
	“He didn’t fully forgive me, though. He made me go through ten long trials, testing my mental ability and my will to never commit murder again.” he took another deep breath. “I completed all ten trials.”
	“Finally, the being above all beings granted me the power to talk to people in their minds, the power of teleportation, and the ability to go back in time.” the man said.
	Elliot was still confused. The man had told him everything about himself, and he still knew basically nothing about who he was.
	“Who are you?” Elliot asked.
	“People have called me by many names. Inmate. Prisoner. Murderer. All-Powerful. Supernatural. Master.” he said.
	“People call you their master?” Elliot asked. 
	“Yes.” he said, seeming to relish Elliot’s surprise and confusion.
	Elliot was starting to want to have these powers. What was there to lose?
	“How could I… get those powers?” Elliot asked slowly.
	“Don’t worry, my friend. Don’t worry. Your time will come.” The man said, smiling with all his teeth.
