Chapter 5
Mae
	Oliver was incredibly interesting. Mae had thought that he had been an incredibly boring, (somewhat quiet) person. Well, that was until Oliver had told her that he could read minds. That was crazy. Scratch Tulip Street, which now was about as interesting as reading the entire dictionary.
	Mae had to face the hard decision, whether or not to tell other people about Oliver’s secret. On the one hand, people would be amazed about Oliver’s ability, and maybe Mae would get more popular after that. On the other hand, Oliver would get extremely mad at Mae for telling other people. And then he wouldn’t be able to help more.
	Oliver had already helped a lot. He had somehow deciphered those weird hieroglyphic-type symbols on a 1000 year old slip of paper, which was crazy. Mae wished that he had asked Oliver how he did it.
	Even though the sun was starting to set, Mae wasn't planning on heading down for dinner. She went immediately to her computer. On it, she searched up: “Tulip Street”.
	Yes, it was dumb. And she had done it millions of times before, but Mae just had to keep on searching it, for the desperate hope that something new would happen. A new result on the millions of options and links on Google.
	Her hands cold with anticipation, she typed the words into the search bar and clicked enter. As usual, there were a million results of Tulip Street lookalikes. 

5509 Tulip Street! One link screamed. Low and Affordable Prices!
Directions to 42 Tulip Street, Kentucky - 12 hour drive.
21 Tulip Avenue - Yard Sale.

All of the results (as predicted) weren’t the actual Tulip Street. Mae sighed. She was about to head down to dinner, when one result made her stop in her tracks.

Government Warning - Case 429: Tulip Street

Contrary to the typical blue color of the search results, this link was displayed in a blood red. Her hand shaking, she clicked on the result.
The website was shabby, as if it hadn’t been maintained in years. The font was weird and it looked just like a random PDF file.
There was a government stamp on the top right of the page, making it look pretty official.

Case 429 (A Comprehensive Study)
Officials have reported multiple “disappearances” around area code 424. The disappearances haven’t been linked to any one person or suspect, but private investigators will look into it.

	Mae wondered why the number after “area code” was completely black. Was it just a fluke? A glitch? Or was it on purpose?

It is said to have taken place in Tulip Street, a mysterious place that seems to, after reporters checked, have 0 inhabitants. That leaves the question: Why and who would cause the disappearances if there aren’t any inhabitants in Tulip Street?

	Mae knew exactly which words were in place of the blackened text. Tulip Street.

This investigation is set to be “ongoing”. According to surveyors, the damage in this location is moderate until further notice.

	Moderate damage? How could some place as beautiful as Tulip Street have any damage whatsoever?
	Mae scratched that thought out of her head after she remembered what happened to her cousin.

	Just as Mae was going to scroll further down in the website, the screen flickered slightly. The font became weird, and the computer started to darken. Mae could hear the fans in her computer whirring like crazy.
	A small popup next to her search bar said, “your browser is not responding,” and below it, two options: “Close browser,” or “reload.”
	The computer was now hyper. The fans were on full blast, and the desk that the computer was on was starting to get hot. The screen became progressively darker.
	Mae decided to click the second option. Reload. It was the only option, because she didn’t want to lose the tab. 

	The tab took a very long time to reload. The computer became progressively hotter. Her hands, which were resting on the keys, were starting to hurt because of the heat. The fans were the loudest that she had ever heard. 
	When it finally reloaded, the tab was completely white. Written in a small font was: Error. This tab doesn’t exist.
	In an even smaller font below were the words, “Check if there is a typo in the URL of this page.” 
	This couldn’t be happening. It wasn’t possible. URLs don’t change after you reload the page.
	That was the closest Mae had gotten to finding out more about Tulip Street, and that chance was snapped right out of her hands after less than a minute.
	“Come eat, Mae! We’ve been waiting for you for over 15 minutes!” Dad’s voice rang out from downstairs.
	“Coming!” Mae yelled.

	Dinner was great. However, she had an itching feeling as if she had something better to do. Like surfing the web to find out more about Tulip Street. Or to find out why that website was blocked and “did not exist” despite Mae reading the contents of that very website just a few minutes ago.
	When she finished dinner (which she did very fast), she sped upstairs to brush her teeth and go to “sleep”.
	“Mae? Where did you go?” Mom’s voice echoed out from downstairs.
	“I’m sleeping!” Mae said.
	“This early?” Dad asked.
	“Yes!” Mae said, thinking of an excuse. “School is very tiring, you know!” 
	“All right,” Mom said.
	“Good night,” Dad said.

	Her parents probably had suspicions that she wasn’t really going to sleep, but that didn’t deter her. She stayed awake for hours, checking every single website about Tulip Street that she could. It got boring after a while, but when she checked the time, it was already midnight.
	Time flies…
	
	Just then, a notification popped up on Mae’s computer. 
	1 unread message - Email.
	She clicked it, still annoyed that she wasn’t able to find anything about Tulip Street.
	
Hi. This is Oliver. The kid from school. I have to keep this quick - I got your Email address after looking at the school files, but that isn’t important…
I have important information about.. you-know-what.
I can’t tell you about it over text - my dad will find out. I have to tell it to you in real life.
Meet after school 2morrow?
Oliver
	Mae had to know what Oliver found out.
	Quickly, she typed a message back.

	Got your message. I’ll meet you after school tomorrow. I also found an interesting website about you-know-what. A government one, and it looks pretty official. The only thing is, the website crashed and now it says that the page doesn’t exist.
	I’ll talk to you about it more later.
	Cya after school!

	Her hand shaking with excitement, she clicked send. She couldn’t wait to hear what Oliver had found.
Mae now had the possibility of knowing more about Tulip Street.
	As she went to sleep, she could only dream of what could happen next. What could happen with her beloved Tulip Street.
