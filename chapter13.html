Chapter 13
Elliot
	“Your first assignment is to follow my every direction and move,” the man said. “Call me Master.” 
	“Ok,” Elliot said, almost robotically.
	“Ok, Master,” he corrected.
	“Yes, yes, ok, Master. Get to the point. Where are we going?” Elliot asked.
	“We’re going to a little place called Tulip Street.” Master said, smiling that creepy smile again.
	It felt like a long walk, but finally, they were at another shrine-like place. A small portal-looking thing was in the center of a large cobblestone opening. Mossy stone walls lined the perimeter of the shrine.
	Master murmured some words, and the portal started glowing. It also seemed to be almost vibrating with energy.
	“You may go first,” Master said.
	“Alright… do I just go straight through it?” Elliot asked.
	“Yes. And if my calculations are correct, we’ll appear in a shrine just two miles west of Tulip Street.” Master said.
	“Cool.”
	Elliot stepped up to the portal and walked through it. He could feel the air whooshing pass his face. He was vibrating with energy and excitement, and he couldn’t tell if that was because of the portal or just because he was so excited.
	Is this what it was like to be in a car? On a plane? 
	And before he knew it, he was pushed out back into the world, in another, different shrine.
	Master appeared shortly after. He looked unfazed, probably because he had done it many times.
	“Hey, you said you could teleport before. Why didn’t you just teleport me here without having to use the shrine teleportation thingy?” Elliot asked.
	“I cannot teleport other people, only myself. It is safer if I use the shrine with you, so that I can make sure that the shrine doesn’t malfunction and… collapse…” Master said slowly. “You do not know what a collapsed shrine does… right?”
	“Yes… I don’t know.” Elliot said.
	“Yes, Master.” Master corrected.
	“Yes, Master. I don’t know.” Elliot said.
	“A collapsed shrine kills whoever is in it. If you go through it, you don’t come out. It’s kind of like a black hole. You don’t know where you go or what happens when you get sucked into it.” Master said.
	Elliot shivered.
	“Is there… a way to uncollapse a collapsed shrine?” Elliot asked, nervously. “Or does a collapsed shrine stay that way for eternity? Waiting to kill those too unfortunate to step foot in one…”
	“There is a way to uncollapse a collapsed shrine… but I cannot tell you. I have only met you for less than a day; I do not trust you with all of my secrets… yet, at least.” Master said.
	“But you can gain my trust by completing your first assignment. Now, follow me.” 
	Elliot nodded and followed. The path became denser and denser with trees, branches, leaves, and mud. Eventually a large boulder was blocking the path that Master was going. 
	Master started walking around the boulder, rearing back to head towards the direction of where he was going.
	Master said that he was leading Elliot to Tulip Street… What the heck is Tulip Street? Was it something related to magical powers or the supernatural?
	It felt like a long time, but finally, they walked the three miles to Tulip Street.
	It was amazing. 
	Elliot was amazed at the neatly lined houses, perfectly cut lawn, beautifully trimmed bushes, everything about Tulip Street was perfect. It was a perfectionist’s dream.
	“Is this… Is this Tulip Street?” Elliot said slowly.
	“Yes,” Master said.
	“It’s… beautiful…” Elliot said, mesmerized by the colors of the houses and the perfect rows of bushes.
	“I know…” Master said, somewhat bored, as if he had heard and seen a thousand people remark over how cool and amazing Tulip Street was.
	“So why did you want me to come here?” Elliot asked.
	“I told you already. Your first assignment.” Master said.
	“And that would be…?”
	“Here.” Master said. He reached into one of his many sacks and pockets to retrieve a small, wretched object. It looked greasy and slimy, and was green, kind of like snot. It smelled like what you would expect, as well. Kind of like snot mixed with dead fish.
	“Why would that… putrid object be needed in my assignment? What does it do?” Elliot asked.
	“Well, it basically knocks you out. Unconscious. For about three to twelve hours. It depends on the person.” 
	“Are you saying that I’m going to have to knock someone out?” Elliot asked nervously.
	“Yep.” Master said nonchalantly. “Okay, look, kid. Do you really want special powers? Well then, you’re going to have to fight for them. I have multiple other servants, and they can easily outdo you. But with practice, I’m sure you’ll be able to make your way up my rankings. And only then, will you be able to have the most powerful abilities in the universe.”
	“All right…” Elliot said.
	“All right, Master,” Master said.
	“All right, Master.” Elliot said.
	“Okay. Good. So basically you have to throw that slimy green ball into—”
	“W-wait… I have to touch one of those slimy green balls? Like, in my hand? That would be gross…” Eliot interrupted.
	“Of course you’re going to have to touch one of those. Look, if you’re going to want to be one of my serva— apprentices, then you’re going to have to listen to me.” Master explained.
	“Yes, Master.” Elliot said.
	“Now, as I was saying. I have two kids that I want you to knock unconscious.” Master said. He eyed Elliot’s nervous look and said, “You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to. But if you do, then you will be on track to be gaining immense powers that will make you a god.”
	“Okay. So I have to throw a ball somewhere in order to knock two kids unconscious?” Elliot asked. He couldn’t believe those words would ever come out of his mouth. He was becoming a criminal… but… if it were to get those powers…
	“Right. I’ll tell you where and when to throw the ball.” Master said, as he handed one of the slimy green balls into Elliot’s hand.
	It felt sticky, and slightly warm to the touch. It felt weird. Almost like it shouldn’t exist, and it would disappear as soon as he let go of the object.
	He gripped the object harder. 
	It felt like a while of walking through hundreds of the same houses, same bushes, same everything. He would probably go crazy if he had to walk through these houses every day.
	Eventually, Master stopped, and slowly turned around.
	“Here,” he said. “Now follow me.” 
	Master gingerly opened the door, closing it softly, to make as little sound as possible. He hid behind a wall, and gestured for Elliot to come. 
	Master snapped softly, and a spark of green-blue fire emitted from his fingers. It had gone as fast as it had appeared.
	Elliot was shaking. Should he really do this? But… if he could get those powers…
	Master held three fingers up. Then two. Then one. Then, Master mouthed, NOW. 
	Elliot threw the slimy balls towards the living room. It immediately exploded with green vapor, filling up the entire room.
	“Did you get them?” Master asked, as they headed into the room. There were two unconscious children, about Elliot’s age. One a girl, and one a boy. The boy looked a lot like Elliot, though…. It was probably a hallucination.
	“Yes.” Elliot replied; emotionless.
	“Good job… good job…” Master said.
	“When can I get your powers?” Elliot asked.
	“Patient, my child. You refer to me as Master. And your powers will come soon, if you continue your helpfulness,” Master said.
“Yes… Master,” Elliot said. “What do we do now?”
	“I’ll show you one of my loyal serva— partners,” Master said.
	“Cool,” the boy said.
	What was Master trying to say? Servants? Could that be how Master viewed Elliot? As a loyal servant?
	Elliot tried not to think about it.
	Together, Master and Elliot walked away, out of the house, and to Master’s partner.
	Elliot could only dream of who Master’s partner is.
	And he was going to meet them… today.
