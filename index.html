Prologue 

6 years ago


The man that he was speaking to would be dead within a day. Or at least that's what was supposed to happen. See, he was the operator of the lethal injections that could end someone’s life within minutes. Although, this time, there was one thing that was different from the norm. Scientists from all over the world were testing something that could be world-breaking. Teleportation. The plan was simple: Teleport the subject from the prison to the injection room.
He didn’t know the details about how the teleportation would work. Something about the transferring of atoms or particles. Either way, the scientists claimed that the teleportation would work with a 100% certainty. Of course, if the man who was going to be put to death died during the teleportation, nothing would change because he would die a few minutes after the injection anyway. 
The clock seemed to get slower as the time neared the injection. The subject would already be preparing for his last moments; showering, eating his last meal, and other necessities. 
The time finally came for the teleportation to occur. The man was put into this device that looked like a torture device from a horror movie. A large metal contraption which had large lasers pointed at every section of the man’s body. A person in an orange suit clicked a button with a HAZARD sign on it, and suddenly the room became brighter than the sun. When the brightness became dimmer, the lasers that were pointed at, previously, a human, were pointed at thin air. Only a slight wisp of smoke emitted from the empty contraption. Anxious murmurs were heard throughout the small crowd (only select members from top government officials were allowed to see this contraption in action). 
	Another group of men was already stationed at the injection room, preparing to see the man that had been teleported. The whole room seemed to collectively hold their breath as a radio turned on, speaking the words, “Attention, Code-Orange alarm. Subject 228 is missing. I repeat, Subject 228 is missing.”
	The anxious group seemed to erupt all at once, accusations along the lines of, “why in the world would we do this unethical experiment?” being shouted in the room.
	
	The room eventually quieted down, but what was left was one question: Where did the subject go?

***
The man sat for hours at his desk, contemplating his decisions. Obviously he should do it. Master would force him to, one way or another. Still, it didn’t feel right. 
He ran his hand over his hair, disheveling it, and then smoothing it back again. Despite the warmth of the summer air, his hands were shaking violently. Several years ago, the decision to obey his master’s orders wouldn’t have been a struggle, but now it was different. The task he had been sent to do sounded simply unethical, even absurd. It had the possibility of ending the world.
Of course, he had never seen his master, so at times, he did have to question master’s ability to kill. Although the fact that his master could talk to him at any given moment surely was a factor in that he had been dragged into something supernatural the moment he had obeyed his master’s first order.
Master had promised him glory. Power. The strength of a god. Who wouldn’t have accepted? Not him. Each day, bit by bit, he had grown stronger and more powerful. With his power, his greed had grown as well. He had to get more power, and this task was the only way to continue.
The possibility of gaining  more power, more strength, more glory. The possible death if he didn’t follow through with the order. Everything made him want to proceed with the order.
He had finally come up with his decision.

He opened a book, titled: Journal. It all began now. And there was nothing he could do to stop it after it had started.

6 months later.

	The man opened the journal again, preparing for his final entry. His hand numb from the hours of work, and from the freezing winter air that felt like molten nails being pressed into skin. He began to write.

	This is my last entry. Master, if you are reading this, Operation Blooming Tulip is a success. The creatures have been created. It is now up to you to release them.

	He felt like he wanted to add more, like why he couldn’t release the creatures himself, or why this had to be his last entry, but it was better to leave those questions unanswered. He sensed that his master already knew those answers.
	After six long months, the man was finished with what his master had asked him to do. It was up to time to test if the creation would grant him immense power, or destroy Earth forever.
