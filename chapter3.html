	Chapter 3
	Elliot
		Each day passed slowly. Nobody to talk to. No friends. Nothing. Occasionally, people came to the orphanage, looking for someone to adopt. For years, kids disappeared with a new family; a new home; a new life. Elliot had none of that. Nobody wanted him, and that’s how it was for his entire life at the orphanage.
		The orphanage was crowded. Filled with kids of varying ages, and the morale was low. There was the same food for every meal of the day. Some kind of stew that could have anything from a chicken leg to miscellaneous vegetables inside it.
		Elliot didn’t mind this. He was fine with the status quo. Well, he was fine with the living conditions and the schooling, but he wasn’t fine with the food. 
		He had tried cooking by himself, once. He had snuck into the kitchens at night because he was so hungry. This was because he skipped dinner after one of the kids noticed that the chicken leg in his stew was half-eaten. Elliot had no idea how to cook, but he had seen movies of people putting dough into ovens and bread magically coming out. He figured he could do the same.
		He noticed a large bag labeled, “flour” and dumped a small amount into a bowl. He added water and mixed it together. After testing the proportions of water to flour and finally managed to create a dough-like substance. 
		Elliot inserted the dough into the oven and after waiting for a while, he peered into the oven and saw that it was more than done; it was slightly burnt. Nonetheless, he turned off the oven, opened it, waited for the bread to cool down, and took it out. He put the loaf (if you could call it that) of bread onto a plate and took a bite out of it.
		The bread hadn’t risen, as there wasn’t any yeast to add, but it was better than anything he had ever eaten in the orphanage. After finishing the whole loaf, his mouth still watered and his stomach growled for more. 
	
		Since that time when he first ventured into the depths of the kitchen, he had continued trying out new recipes for bread and eating when he pleased.
		In his bed, he couldn’t sleep. His mind was filled with thoughts. As usual, one of the thoughts was wondering what his family was. Did they willingly abandon him, or did something darker happen? Could… could his parents have died before Elliot could meet them?
		Elliot tried to shake away the thoughts, but of course, they only came back stronger. He decided that he would try to find out who his family was. If he could find who his family was, he would be able to find out if his parents were alive or not.
		From that point on, Elliot decided that his one and only goal was to find out who his parents were and why he was sent to the orphanage. It would take a lot of searching, but he was determined.
		
		Now, over the hundreds of times that Elliot had gone to the kitchen, he remained undetected. However, the threat of being seen was imminent. Every time he had gone to the kitchen to try to create food was another chance that the grown-ups would find him. 
		The grown-ups, or The Human Hawks, as the kids in the orphanage called them, would be looking at everyone with hawk-like piercing eyes (hence the name, The Human Hawks).
		Despite The Human Hawks, Elliot decided to re-enter the kitchen again the next day. Elliot eventually drifted off into a restless sleep.
	
		It’s a cold windy night. You scold yourself for being late to Tulip Street. It won’t  happen again. Master won’t let you. You get back to work. The assignment that Master gave you is difficult, but you think you can persevere. 
		Your hands shake from the cold, frigid from the palm to the fingertip; frozen like a popsicle. Despite this, you continue on, knowing that Master’s consequences would be dire if you don’t complete the assignment.
		Mind reading, telekinesis, teleportation, future-telling. Those were only some of your assignments. Assignments that Master gave you. You won’t fail. You haven’t failed since you pledged your allegiance to Master. 
		A voice enters your head. It’s cold and echoing, filling your head with an ear-splitting hiss. You recognize this voice. It’s your master.
	
		There seemed to be a pool of sweat in Elliot’s small bed. What was that? It had never happened before. Elliot saw the dream… or was it reality… of someone else. No, it wasn't him merely seeing someone else. He was someone else. 
		Elliot was so confused, he thought that he was still in that weird Tulip Street place. He thought that he still had pledged his allegiance to that confusing master guy. Elliot still felt that the cold voice of the “master” was in his head. 
		Eventually, he convinced himself that he wasn’t that weird guy at Tulip Street. He prayed that the dream wouldn’t occur again. However, whatever he did wasn’t enough.
	
		“Are you done with your assignment?” A voice hisses in your ear. The voice echoes in your skull and you try to remind yourself that Master isn’t speaking to you directly; master wasn’t even in the room. 
		“No,” you say slowly. “Master. I promise I can do it… give me more time and I’ll give you the teleportation device… It-it’s not finished yet. I’m afraid it’ll malfunction…”
		Your voice is wavering, and you sense that Master doesn’t like that.
		“I want it NOW!” Master yells. You nearly black out. 
		“Master… if you give me one more day, I’ll be able to—”
		“SILENCE. You will give me the device,” Master says coldly.
		You’re sure that the device will fail unless you fix it and examine it more thoroughly, but Master’s orders…
		He’ll punish you most severely if he finds out that the machine is faulty. Even though it is Master’s fault for not giving you more time.
		You shrug it off and head to your Master, knowing that the days that lie ahead will be full of pain and suffering.
	
		Elliot was desperate at this point. Desperate for a solution, a reason, anything that could explain this supernatural dream-thingy. Why did these dreams happen in the first place? Who even was this person? Why were they involved in being a servant to some kind of omniscient god-like “Master” person? Why were they creating teleportation machines? And most importantly, at least to Elliot: Where was Tulip Street? 
	If Elliot knew where Tulip Street was, then he’d be able to find out where the Master was, and what he was doing with the teleportation devices. 
	Elliot decided that he would have 3 goals. His main goal now was to find out where Tulip Street was, and to find out more about Master. His second goal was to find out why he had the ability (if you could call it an ability, because it was more like a nuisance) and how to use it. Finally, he wanted to find his family. 
	Was his weird dreams connected with his family or why was he in an orphanage? Or was it something else?
	Elliot was determined to answer these questions.
	He checked outside. It was still night. Apparently, no time had passed since the previous dream. He slept again, hoping desperately that the dreams wouldn’t come again.
	
	Elliot woke up. Yes, he could tell that he was himself this time, instead of that other guy in Tulip Street. Things felt more real.
	Despite knowing that he wasn’t the guy who was the servant of the Master, he still felt as if he had to finish the assignment, whatever that was. Elliot almost forgot what he wanted to do, his mind clouded with the dream, making his thoughts and decisions distorted.
	He eventually got up, made his bed, and headed towards the cafeteria. It was small, and the tables were breaking down. If you sat on one of the seats, they would probably crumple under your weight. Despite this, he had to get food in his stomach or he would starve. (Sometimes he preferred the ladder)
	A big sign displayed what was for the meals of the day: 
	
	Breakfast - Assorted Vegetables + Mystery Soup
	Lunch - Stew (Combination of leftovers)
	Dinner - Mystery Meat + Stew
	
	Yep. That was the typical food. And when they said, “mystery,” that typically meant that they would combine leftovers from the last days and add random condiments and food scraps.
	Elliot grabbed one of the bowls that contained the “Mystery Soup.” (He decided to pass on the “Assorted Vegetables” because it looked like mold was growing on them) The food looked as bad as the cafeteria. Some green substance floated on one side of the bowl, and a bone with some meat still attached hovered in the center. Some stringy thing strapped itself around Elliot’s spoon.
	He decided that he would pass on today’s breakfast. He prayed that tomorrow’s “Mystery Soup” would be better. Elliot surreptitiously dumped the contents of the bowl into the trash, knowing that if he got caught by one of The Human Hawks, he’d have to scrape the soup out of the trash and force it down his throat. (Which was one of the strict rules in the orphanage: One must not waste food)
	Elliot promised himself that he would go downstairs to the kitchen and cook himself a nice dinner tonight. He could just imagine the warm loaf of bread out of the oven, combined with some butter, if he could find some. 
	The day passed with almost nothing out of the ordinary. (Unlike the night…)
	He had skipped both breakfast and lunch, and he was becoming hungry. After school, his stomach felt like it was going to shrivel up and dissolve itself. 
	After his mind (annoyingly) gave him visions of a beautiful loaf of bread, melted butter spread on the surface, he finally gave in. He was going to go to the kitchen again.
	Now, Elliot typically went to the kitchen in the night, as he had the cover of darkness. This time, he would have to be ten times more careful. If The Human Hawks caught him stealing the food, he’d be in big trouble.
	He crept down the spiraling stairs, careful not to tread on some of the crumbling steps.
	The stairs widened into a small hallway with doors leading to rooms left and right. On the doors were labels: Kitchen or Storage.
	Elliot had never ventured farther than the kitchen. From what he could see, the hallway seemed to go on indefinitely. However, he shouldn’t stray from his designated path, otherwise one of two things would happen: He’d either get lost, or one of The Human Hawks would find him.
	Elliot entered the kitchen, hands shaking slightly from excitement. He could almost smell the bread that was going to come out of the oven.
	The kitchen was small. Only one small lamp had the job of illuminating the room, and it was flickering every three seconds. A small window was located towards the ceiling, and half the view was blocked with dirt. The shelf was on the verge of breaking, and it was bending slightly under the pressure of three bags of flour. Despite this, the kitchen was the best sight that he had seen.
	He got to work immediately. He couldn’t waste time, otherwise he’d get caught. He grabbed a bowl that didn’t look too broken down and dirty and added a generous amount of flour. He then added water to the bowl, and mixed it with a spoon. After playing around with the proportions of water to flour, he finally made a dough-like substance.
	It wouldn’t rise, because he didn’t have yeast, but it would do.
	He put the dough into the oven and turned it on. This was one of the things that he was most proud of. Through trial and error, he had found the perfect temperature and duration at which to bake his dough. 
	He seemed to wait for the dough to be finished for hours, but it was all worth it. He finally got a large flat bread that smelled delicious. Now, his stomach was rumbling more ferociously.
		Elliot looked around to find butter, and finally he found half a stick in the fridge. 
		He grabbed a small knife and cut the bread into slices. The bread was beautiful. It was warm, the outside crunchy, and the inside soft. Using a butter knife, Elliot smeared a generous amount of butter onto the slice of bread.
		He took a bite out of the bread. It was the best food he’d eaten in his entire life. It was warm, soft and delicious. He could eat this for the rest of his life.
		After he finished his fifth slice of bread, he was mostly full. There were still a few more slices left, and he decided that he’d store it underneath his bed. 
		Elliot’s skin prickled, and he had the distinct feeling that something bad would happen.
		Two voices broke the silence in the kitchen. And the people who were making those voices? They were definitely The Human Hawks. And they were coming to get Elliot.
		Elliot flung himself into one of the storage closets, praying that The Human Hawks wouldn’t see the half-eaten loaf of bread. 
		The closet was rancid. It smelled like dirty socks, and it was moist. It was a breeding ground for mold, insects, and other gross things. He would have to grit his teeth and get through it, because The Human Hawks would come here at any moment.
		“I swear, if there’s a kid down here, at this hour…” one of the voices said angrily. It was a man.
		“Can’t be. Must’ve been one of the rodents scurrying around,” the other voice said. It was a woman.
		“Doubt,” the man said.
		“Well, I guess we’ll see,” the woman said.
		The footsteps were getting closer, clacking down the hallway. Click clack click clack…
		“Where d’you think the noises came from?” the man asked.
		“No idea. Perhaps the storage room?” the woman suggested.
		“Hmph. Let's check it, I guess,” the man said.
		The footsteps went away and towards the storage room. Elliot breathed a sigh of relief, and quickly stifled it. He couldn’t be making noise in the kitchen, or The Human Hawks would get him.
		“Nothin’. Zilch. Nobody in the storage room…” the man said.
		“I guess we could search the kitchen?” the woman provided.
		“Sure,” the man said.
		“And if there’s nobody in the kitchen, I’m going back to sleep,” the woman said, sounding exasperated.
		Elliot’s heartbeat sped up a million times. He was going to get found, and there was nothing he could do to stop it.
		“Who’s in here?” The man yelled. The voice nearly made Elliot jump, but if he did, he’d hit his head. The closet was short, and he had to bend his knees slightly in order to keep from bashing his head on the closet roof. His knees were on fire.
		There was a rustling noise that sounded like it was coming from two inches to the right of his ear. His heart was beating as fast as lightning. He was sure The Human Hawks would find him.
		And what if they did? The Human Hawks would probably kick him out of the orphanage or something. The orphanage wasn’t much, but at least there was food and shelter…
		Suddenly, Elliot collapsed. He was paralyzed. He couldn’t move. Then, he woke up again.
	
	
	
		“Oliver. I’m going to send you to school today. I have… important things to do when you’re gone,” you say. You know that the “important things” are really just your assignment in Tulip Street.
		Oh, how you longed to complete that assignment. Master took that option away. Your assignment, which you worked for hundreds of days and nights, was snatched away from you. You know that the device wouldn’t work. After all that time, Master chooses to get the device when it wasn’t even finished?
		“Ok father,” Oliver said slowly. His eyes glinted, like he knew something that he shouldn’t.
		You will have to look into that, but Master’s assignment is much more important than your son.
		You drive your son to school, and immediately head to Tulip Street. The road narrows down until the car can’t fit. You have to trek this part on foot. This was one of the advantages of Tulip Street. There was no way someone could find it.
		The sight of Tulip Street was always breathtaking. You know you can’t get absorbed into it too much, though. Master is always watching…
		Your mind wanders to the child that you used to have.
	
	
		
		Elliot.
