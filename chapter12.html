Chapter 12
Oliver
	Oliver was simply dumbstruck. Mae was on the floor of the house, unconscious. The words, “I know what you did, Oliver Stone,” were displayed on the wall in the house. Who could’ve written that down and thrown the green balls at them?
	Certainly not Oliver’s dad. His dad already went to work… or, his dad’s “work” could’ve been at Tulip Street… 
	Those thoughts flashed through Oliver’s head in a split-second. Whoever threw those green balls had the intention of knocking both of them unconscious, so Oliver played dead.
	He knew that the green vapor caused you to go unconscious, so he inhaled a deep breath of air, and held his breath.
	He crumbled down, hitting the wood floor harder than he intended to. He closed his eyes, setting his limbs and body in a lifeless position. It was perfect.
	“Did you get them?” a deep, gruff voice asked.
	“Yes,” a young voice replied. The voice had to come from someone Oliver’s age. 
	“Good job… good job…” the voice said.
	“When can I get your powers?” the young voice asked.
	“Patient, my child. You refer to me as Master. And your powers will come soon, if you continue your helpfulness,” the gruff voice said.
	“Yes, Master,” the young voice said. “What do we do now?”
	“I’ll show you one of my loyal serva— partners,” the man with the gruff voice said.
	“Cool,” the boy said.
	The footsteps got fainter as the two people walked away. What was the man with the gruff voice trying to say? Servants? He had servants who… uh… served him? What’s up with that? And why did he have to cut that off and say partners instead?
	Who was that young boy? And why did he sound so familiar? 
	Oliver was feeling like his lungs were about to burst. He left the room, and entered another one. This room didn’t have any green vapor in it. He took a deep breath, and headed back into the living room.
	Even opening his eyes made his eyes burn. 
	He examined where the old words were, but they were gone, replaced by the words, “Elliot is now my loyal servant. What are you?”
	Oliver knew, somehow, that the question, “What are you?” was directed at him. 
	What was he? Certainly not a servant…
	Elliot on the other hand… that was his brother! How was that possible? That young boy must’ve been Elliot! And that must be why he sounded so familiar! They were twins!
	Why had Elliot chosen to become on the evil Master’s side? The Master must’ve tricked Elliot into doing so, somehow.
	This was crazy. All his life he had wondered if he had a sibling or not. He was lonely as an only child. But now, as he found out who his actual brother was, he wasn’t so sure.
His mind wasn’t completely sane, because he had inhaled a small amount of that vapor, and he was feeling woozy. But in his mind, it seemed clear that he had to follow Elliot and that man.
