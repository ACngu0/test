   Chapter 1
   Oliver
      His father almost never talked to him. It got to the point when Oliver would stay in his room for hours at a time with no food, no one to talk to. That was fine, in his opinion. It was how he found out that he wasn’t normal. It was so sudden, but when it happened, it hit him like a car. 
      It was a cold winter morning four years ago. He was sitting in his room, waiting for nothing, fidgeting. Then, the room that was supposed to be silent erupted with a voice. More than that, it felt like someone was whispering into his ear. He glanced back, expecting to see his father’s cold eyes, but seeing nothing except empty air. Strange. He was probably imagining things.
      It should be happening any time now… When he wakes up… No, it couldn’t be… it was a fluke… not supposed to happen… I guess I’ll have to wait and see… 
      After hearing the voice again, Oliver nearly fell out of his chair. The voice was familiar… it was… it was his dad’s. Yes, he could hear the voice clearly now. It was more than a whisper and the words were almost as crisp as the cool air.
      Oliver looked around again, scanning the room for the source of the voice. Nothing.
      Oliver’s door opened, (which didn’t typically happen) and his dad came out, his dull blue eyes colder than ever.
      “Why are you here?” Oliver asked coldly. Father coming into his room was a rare occasion, but it wasn’t usually a happy one. 
      “Nothing. Just checking,” Oliver’s father said.
      How come I can’t hear anything from him?
      Oliver tried to not jump out of his seat after hearing these words, which was quite weird, as he had just heard his father’s voice despite not seeing him talk.
      “Checking on what?” he asked.
      “None of your business,” Oliver’s father said dismissively. He turned and exited the room.
      Nosey kid. I’ll have to pay attention to him more. Something is fishy. Gotta find out how he does that. Master would like to know. It’ll help me with my… operation in Tulip Street.
      Oliver’s head was swimming with thoughts. First off: What was fishy? Surely not him. He was pretty normal, (except for the voice in his head) at least he thought he was. Second: What was he doing? What did his father suspect? He wasn’t hiding anything! Third: Who was master? Fourth: What was Tulip Street? He was going to find out, no matter what.
   
      It turned out that he was a terrible spy. After 4 years of trying to listen to his father, he still didn’t know who the master was. Despite this, he found out what the voices were, especially after his father sent him to school. (Despite not going to school in his younger years, he was still able to catch up to his age level) The voices were the thoughts of other people. There was no mistaking it.
      
      In school, they were sharing out loud a story that “shocked them” as an English project for the start of the year. All the kids droned on about some semi-interesting stories until one girl showed up. 
      “I’m Mae. I’m going to tell you all the story of The Legend of Tulip Street,”
      The rest of the kids remain seated, gazing slightly above the door, or doodling silently on one of their homework assignments.
      B-o-r-i-n-g. We’ve listened to HUNDREDS of boring stories! Weren’t these stories supposed to be something “shocking?”
      Oliver still wasn’t used to hearing other people’s thoughts. He suspected that he only could hear the thoughts that were most pronounced and “filled with emotion.” However right now, everything was just speculation.
      Mae seemed to get that nobody was paying attention, so she spoke again, louder.
      “The Legend of Tulip Street was not just any ordinary street. Rows of identical houses were set in perfect rows, stretching for miles. They say that strange things happen in Tulip Street,” Mae said, and then paused. “Teleportation. A man supposedly figured out how to teleport in Tulip Street.”
      Now, people were on the edge of their seats. They seemed eager to hear more about teleportation. Oliver on the other hand was more than eager. He was desperate. He was desperate to know more about the problem that had stuck with him for over four years of his life. What was Tulip Street?
      “Ahem, Mae? We do not joke around when telling our stories,” our teacher, Mrs. Brown said.
      “I’m not joking. It’s the truth,” Mae said stubbornly.
      “You are saying that teleportation, which, mind you, is a completely fictional thing, exists in this world?” Mrs. Brown whispers with a fake smile. “I don’t think so.”
      “You’ll see,” Mae said and then she walked back to her seat. She seemed to relish the effect that was cast upon the room. People were staring, slack jawed, at Mae. They all wanted to ask her about teleportation. The teacher seemed to sense this.
      “Do not get out of your seats until the bell rings,” Mrs. Brown said.
      Oliver needed to know more about Tulip Street. It could explain everything. It could explain why his dad never talked to him. It might explain why he could read people’s minds. Oliver was desperate to know. Anything as superstitious as perfectly set houses and teleportation must’ve been correlated with his powers. (If you could call them that)
      Oliver knew exactly what to do. He’d ask Mae more about Tulip Street after class, and he wouldn’t stop until she answered. Oliver knew that other kids would want to know more about Tulip Street.
      The teacher continued with the class, scowling at Mae. Before Oliver knew it, the class was over, and he had completely forgotten everything that the teacher had said. The only thing left in Oliver’s head was to ask Mae more about Tulip Street. He had somewhat of a plan to do this.
      Just as he suspected, after class, a hoard of kids gathered up around Mae, no doubt asking her about Tulip Street. He could make out that Mae was shaking her head, as if she was declining offers to elaborate on Tulip Street.
   Oliver didn’t want to ask Mae about Tulip street immediately for multiple reasons: One, he knew that Mae was shell-shocked because of what the teacher said. She wouldn’t just go up in front of the entire class to make a fool of herself and lie. Second, Oliver wanted the other kids to clear away before he came. He knew exactly what to say. He’d hit her with the fact about his mind-reading powers, and then Mae would have to spill the beans about Tulip Street.
   Oliver waited a few more minutes. The bell was going to ring. This was the perfect time to ask Mae. After searching for her in the hallways for a little bit, he found Mae. There weren’t any people around her anymore, so Oliver began talking.
   “Hey… Mae?” Oliver asked. “Uhm… about that Tulip Street that you were talking about… can you tell me more about it?”
   “I’m sorry… Oliver, right? I can’t tell you more about Tulip Street,” Mae said slowly.
   “Oh… but… it’d be very important for you to tell me… please?” Oliver wheedled.
   “No. My cousins made me promise… shoot…” Mae said and then immediately stopped. 
   “So your cousins told you about Tulip Street?” Oliver asked.
   “Well, it was more like a spooky story, I don’t even know if it’s true…” Mae whispered, then seemed to realize what she was saying, and shut her mouth, keeping her eyes determinately on the floor.
   “So it isn’t true?” Oliver sighed. After years of waiting to find a clue, a lead, anything, he finally found one, only to figure out that it was some spooky story that somebody told over a campfire. Oliver started to turn away, but Mae’s words brought him back.
   “Fine. I’ll tell you. But only if you tell me something in return,” Mae said smoothly.
   “I don’t… I don’t have…” Oliver began, knowing fully well that he did have something in return to say. Something related to a certain ability to read other people’s minds.
   “Okay, then I don’t have to tell you more about Tulip Street,” Mae said.
   “Fine! I’ll do it! As long as you tell me more about Tulip Street!” Oliver exclaimed. Was it really the right decision to tell someone that he barely knew about his darkest secret? The secret that he had kept for his entire life?
   Oliver’s mind was completely void of thoughts as Mae opened her mouth to speak, when the bell rang.
   “I’m late to class!” Mae said, seeming half-happy to leave the situation without telling Oliver about Tulip Street.
   Oliver was going to find more about Tulip Street, no matter what. After school, he would ask Mae what Tulip Street was, and if he had to tell Mae his secret, he would do it in an instant.
   School sped by faster than a speeding bullet. After school finished, Oliver looked to find an opportunity to speak with Mae, but he couldn’t find any. Just as he was about to give up and head home, he saw her. She was already on her bike, heading somewhere out of the school. He had to talk to her. He couldn’t wait another day. He decided to run after her.
   Fueled with adrenaline and the urge to find out more about Tulip Street, he sprinted towards Mae. However, every moment that he seemed to get closer, close enough to talk to her, she seemed to speed faster and farther away. 
   Eventually, the trail narrowed down, cement turning into gravel. Even later, after what seemed like ages of following Mae, the gravel turned into dirt, and the once sparse trees turned into a jungle.
   By now, it seemed as if every intake of breath was like inhaling molten iron. His lungs felt like they were going to burst. Sweat covered his face. And Mae kept on biking.
   After an eternity, the trail (if you could even call it that) made a sharp turn, and Mae dismounted the bike. She walked slowly towards something. Oliver couldn’t see behind a specially thick group of trees.
   He sped up until he hit the turn. What was in front of him nearly made him faint. There weren’t any other trees past this turn. Clean, unchiped cement lined the ground. In perfect rows, houses on either side of the road were laid with pinpoint accuracy. The sun shone brightly through the houses that looked exactly like each other. This was Tulip Street. Exactly how Mae described it.
