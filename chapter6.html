Chapter 6
Elliot
	Great. Just great. Elliot collapsed on the floor of a dinky closet (which was probably filled with mold), and people were searching for him, ready to throw him the biggest punishment. 
	That vision-type thingy had happened again. And inside a CLOSET! Where else would the visions happen? Inside the bathroom?
	This was weird, but the vision had tons of information. For one, the person that Elliot was “visioning” was… his father? At least that's what he got out of the vision. It was kind of blurry when he tried to recall it.
	“There’s nobody in here,” the male voice growled. Elliot jumped at this voice, nearly crashing his head on the roof of the closet. 
“I wanna go back to sleep.” 
	“Before we go—there’s a troubled boy—Elliot, I think. He’s the quietest boy in the orphanage,” the woman said.
	Elliot’s heart nearly leaped out of his chest and ran out of the room when he heard his name. He tried to slow down his heartbeat because he was sure that The Human Hawks could hear it. His breathing was fast, and his limbs were cold despite the humid closet.
	“What are you trying to say?” The man grumbled.
	“I’m not sure… it’s just that… It's quite unusual how Elliot came here. I mean, it happens sometimes, but still…” The woman paused. “What I’m trying to say is, the man who gave Elliot to the orphanage looked a lot like him, and he had another child next to him. One of the same age.”
“Are you trying to say that Ella and that—”
“Elliot,” the woman corrected.
“Elliot, and that other boy… are twins?” The man paused to think. “That couldn’t be….”
“Exactly. That’s exactly what I’m thinking.”
The two Human Hawks headed upstairs, out of the kitchen, rambling on about Elliot and his mysterious twin.
That was about as close he was ever going to get to knowing more about his family. 
He leaned back, relieved that he was safe from the Human Hawks. And then he fell straight back. The back “wall” of the closet wasn’t really a wall. It was a fake one, almost like paper. He was free falling, towards what seemed like eternal darkness. He couldn’t feel his fingertips. This was going to be where he died…
Finally, he landed on a large cushion. The sudden stop at the end made his neck crack in a weird place, and his vision blurred for a minute.
This must be a big dream. He would wake up, and he wouldn’t be in this dark place. He would be in his comfortable bed, and he would go back to sleep. It would be peaceful.
It took him a while to realize that it wasn’t a dream. He was stuck in this small corridor, with no way to go back out. 
After more time, he finally got the courage to explore the corridor. It was long, but thin, and it winded around like a large snake. 
	Each step that he took made the dinky wooden plates that served as the floor creak and shutter. The wood was slightly splintered, and he was sure that he saw a large patch of mold at some point. The walls were made up of cobblestone bricks that criss-crossed and were various sizes.
	He wandered through the seemingly endless corridor. Eventually, he noticed a small light somewhere far away. He started running, hoping to find the light, somehow. 
	The light only seemed to get farther and farther away the more he ran. After what seemed like hours, the light stopped moving away. He finally reached it.
	The light was blinding. He could barely see anything other than whiteness.
	Even with closing his eyes, the light flashed through his eyelids, causing him to see a bright red. Blindly, he stumbled through the corridor, struggling to put one foot in front of the other. His hands moved around mindlessly, hoping to find an end to the tunnel.
	Finally, he found something. A small wooden door that’s perimeter was covered with some type of metal that felt cool and relaxing to the touch.
	The light started to die down, and, with his eyes burning from the light, he opened the door. Instead of what he was hoping for, (an exit, hopefully leading back to the orphanage) there was just a long staircase. From what he could see, the staircase just led up forever, not stopping at all.
	His hope and morale was near-zero as he started climbing up the steep stairs. 
	His legs were burning, and the only thing in his mind was a primitive animal-like desire to reach the end of these stairs. To reach the top.
	It was hours. It could’ve been more, but he had lost track of time. His mouth was becoming dry, and he was having trouble swallowing. He was sure that he would die of thirst, but he kept going on. He closed his eyes as he continued his ascent. 
	Eventually, he saw a bright light, but not as bright as the previous light. It was bearable. The light was unique, it was full of life. He couldn’t put a finger on it…
	As he continued walking up the stairs, he finally understood what the light was. It couldn’t be anything other than the sun’s light. This staircase must’ve been leading to the outside.
	The orphanage barely ever provided outside time. When he was allowed to go outside, it would always be very rare and it would always be for a really short amount of time. Could this really be the exit to the outside?
	If it was, he wasn’t sure what to feel. The food was horrible in the orphanage, but at least it provided shelter. And he was sure that he would be miles away from the orphanage at this rate, because the corridor was so long.
	The staircase’s walls grew wider, and the cobblestone-brick walls slowly morphed into dirt. 
	For the last time, there was a door at the end of the tunnel. A large door, that stretched from one side of the corridor to the other. 
	Carefully, he opened it, and warm light flooded through the corridor.
	Wait… this couldn’t be. It took a while for Elliot to remember, but it was still night… right? He had gone to the kitchen after dinner, and The Human Hawks nearly caught him during the night. 
	Was he really in the tunnel for an entire night? Time didn’t seem to exist in that tunnel, and he was really bad at keeping track of the time. If someone had told him that one hour had passed while he was in the corridor, he would have believed it just as much as if someone had told him that a week had passed.
	Whatever it was, Elliot didn’t care. He was out. He was free.
	He looked around, scanning where he was. There was a patch of trees to the left, but other than that, it was mostly just an endless field of grass and a lake on the right.
	A lake! Perfect. He would have drinkable water and animals would be living nearby. If he needed them to survive…
	He tried not to think about having to kill an animal.
	Elliot started to head towards the lake when his knees crumpled from underneath him, and he fell, headfirst into the grass. 

	You are going to regret this decision, but it has to be done. His powers are too strong. Or, to put it more accurately, his powers would be too strong in a few years. Better to leave him at the orphanage in order to prevent him from finding out about Tulip Street.
	Oliver on the other hand… he is more unstable. You are not sure how powerful his powers would become, and if he had powers at all. You decide to keep him. If you keep him safe, then maybe you will be able to control his powers.
	Two brothers; two twins. Elliot and Oliver. Both born with immense powers, waiting to make their presence in a few years from now.
	Your mind is still unsettled. Like something is missing. You always get dreams, nowadays, of Elliot escaping from the orphanage. You wonder if that’s just your imagination, or if it’s a remnant of his previous ability to have visions about the future and about other people.
	You tell yourself that it will be fine. The orphanage is safer than Elliot would ever be, and it was virtually inescapable.
	You tilt your head, and start to fall asleep, hoping that the dreams of Elliot escaping wouldn’t come to haunt you again.

	Elliot woke up, his entire body caked with mud and sweat. He must’ve been rolling around as he had his vision. 
	This was crazy… that guy in his vision was definitely his father. This was weird. 
	Just then, his body went completely rigid. 
	Oh no… not another vision…
	However, this time it was different. He was rigid; paralyzed. He couldn’t move. But he didn’t collapse on himself and wasn’t unconscious. A cold voice whispered in his ear, “3m S”. Then, he fell unconscious once again. 
	When he woke up, there was a large bruise on his head. He was sure that he had crashed his noggin on some rock on the way down. Rubbing the bruise gingerly, he used a stick to write on dirt: 3M S. 
	What could that mean? 3 minutes? What did the S mean? 3 minutes south? No, that couldn’t make sense.
	Elliot walked around the drawing of “3M S,” hoping that looking at it from different angles would allow him to come up with an idea about what it meant.
	Could the M mean “more”? Then what would the “S” mean? 
	Elliot finally sat down, not caring anymore that his butt would be caked with another layer of mud. He had no way of deciphering that code, no way back to the orphanage, and he was probably going to die of thirst.
	Wait… could the “M” mean… “Miles?” 3 Miles… that makes sense!
	So then what could the “S” mean? 3 Miles… SOUTH!
	Elliot nearly jumped up in excitement. This certainly was what the code meant. 3 Miles South. It all made sense. He made a mental note of “3 Miles South” and then headed towards the lake.
	This time, he didn’t collapse and have another vision. Soon, he was at the mouth of the lake, and he could just tell that this water was drinkable. He had seen book, video, and movie descriptions of how some lakes were polluted to the point where the water would never be safe to drink. 
	He cupped his hands. Shaking, he took a handful of the liquid. It tasted a little metallic, but other than that, it was the greatest drink of water he had ever had. 
	It was so lucky that the tunnel had led up to a place near a lake and some trees. This was the perfect place to stay, if he wanted to survive. However, he still had a goal in his mind: Find Oliver. 
	After filling up with water, he headed back from where he came. His eyes came back to that drawing: 3M S.
	3… Miles… South. That was definitely it. Now, he didn’t have a compass, or something to tell how far he had traveled, but he thought it would work out.
	He came up with a plan. If the sun rose up from the east, then he could use that information to find out where south was.
	Then, from there, he would walk until he hit 3 miles.
	Now, all he needed to do was to wait.
