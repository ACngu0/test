Chapter 9
Elliot
Ok. Well, turns out, it isn’t that easy to walk three miles without any experience. Picture this: You’re locked up in an orphanage for basically your entire life, and you have NO ability to walk or run even the slightest distance.
Now, compound that with the fact that he was probably gonna die of thirst. Sips from the lake weren’t enough. Where his clothes wore, he was sweating, and where bare skin was, he was freezing. His lips were chapped, and teeth chattering.
Compound that AGAIN with the fact that Elliot had already been walking a lot before, in that corridor underneath the orphanage. He had climbed a thousand stairs and walked ten miles down there. (It was an exaggeration, but you get the point.)
He couldn’t stray from the path, otherwise he’d get lost. 3 miles south. That was where he had to go.

He’d read books before that always had cryptic messages telling the protagonist where to go, and this situation was exactly like that. Why do the messages have to be so cryptic?!
Elliot kept on walking. He kept his gaze on an object far away, and used that object as an anchor. Kind of like a checkpoint. It was to make Elliot feel like he was accomplishing something, despite knowing that three miles was gonna be a lot longer than this.
He was about to decide to walk back to the lake (because he knew that it had a reliable source of water) when right there, straight in the middle of the path, was a long piece of bread. It would last him days if he rationed it correctly.
The piece of bread seemed like it was deliberately put there, but he didn’t care. A piece of bread was a piece of bread, and he was going to eat it.
After checking thoroughly for mold, he scraped off excess dirt and ate a huge bite out of it.
Despite the piece of bread being cold and hard, it was the best thing he had ever tasted. He tried to stuff the piece of bread into his pocket, (Yeah, it sounds disgusting, but how were you supposed to store a piece of bread without a backpack or something?) but it didn’t fit.
He would have to nibble off a few more pieces of the bread in order to be able to stuff it in his pocket.
A few… delicious… bites…
He wanted to eat more, but he had to make the piece of bread last. He stuffed it in his pocket and continued his trek.
It seemed like hours… no… days, but Elliot finally walked three miles. He knew this because there was a shrine-like object right in the path that he was walking. The shrine was about two times taller than Elliot was.
Just then, there was a faint roar. Barely audible. But it was getting louder. And fast.
His heart started beating faster, adrenaline flowing through his veins.
Five.
	Nervous.
			Seconds.

Impact.
Elliot was thrown to the ground, dust covering his face and rocks scraping his limbs. 
Imagine a huge black dog, muscles rippling, with powerful legs and jaws that looked like they could crush bones with ease. Its claws were as sharp as razors. Make that huge dog about as large as a few minivans, and as long as a speedboat. Now, give that creature two twisted horns on its head, and glowing red eyes. Ooh, and also teeth the size of two overripe bananas.
	Then, the creature raced towards Elliot, and rammed him in the stomach. The air, quite literally, was knocked out of him. Elliot’s eyes watering with pain, he watched, in utter horror, as blood seeped out from the gaping wound.
