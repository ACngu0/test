Chapter 8
Oliver
I flicked back to the table of contents, and found a chapter called The Art of Warping.
Warping? What’s Warping?
I turned to page 32, which was The Art of Warping’s page and started reading.
Warping, or changing thoughts, was an art practiced by telepaths many millennia ago. Many ruthless rulers have used it to their advantage. It involved changing another person’s thoughts via a process called Warping. A few restrictions were present, however:
The thought had to be a self-doubted thought in order for that thought to be warped.
It doesn't work on the Warper.
	As the years went on, people with these powers started to dwindle in population, until there were only the emperor's descendants left. And Warping is now only granted to those with powerful minds.
	The “formula” for warping is as follows:
Read the person of choice’s mind. Find the thought in question.
Worm your power inside the thought. See page 452.
Rewrite the thought with your mind.
Eject yourself out of the person’s mind.
	I blinked once, then twice. I felt like I was going to faint.
	I flipped back to the table of contents again. I needed to know more about mind reading and… seeing the future. 
	Can I see the future too?
	I looked at the table and contents. Stories of Ruthless Emperors… no… The Process of Interrogation and other Psychological loop-holes… no… Aha! All you need to know about Mind Reading and Future Sight.
	I continued reading the yellowing pages.
	The power of Mind Reading and Future Sight, it turns out, was genetic. However, Mind Reading and Future Sight wasn’t often gifted to children. This occurrence was rare. It was found out that the rate of having a child with either Mind Reading or Future Sight was 1 in 500. The rate of having both children with Mind Reading or Future Sight was 1 in 2500. That is why the population of people with these gifts are lowering to near zero.
	A child may have both powers, Mind Reading and Future Sight, but that is very rare. In fact, it only happened 2 times in history. See page 289. Children with both gifts have an unusual pattern. Their powers only arise when they become a certain age, which is 12 years old.
	I paused, sighing. I strained my mind to try to remember my earliest memory of having the ability to read someone’s mind. I think it was when I was in preschool, when I was in an argument with some other kid, and he was throwing sand in my eyes.
	Well, now that means that I definitely didn’t have both powers, because it said that people who have both powers only get them when they’re 12 years old, and I first experienced my powers when I was in second grade, at least that’s what I remembered.
	That wouldn’t stop Oliver from trying, though. He glanced at the clock. It was nearly 2 hours past midnight. He had to go to sleep.
	Carefully, he tiptoed upstairs to his room, hoping desperately that he wouldn’t wake his dad up.
	He brushed his teeth and went to bed.
	He could only dream of the next day.
